Wikkit is an IRC bot for the #bukkitwiki channel on EsperNet. From the commands it has programmed in, it reads the RSS Feeds from selected websites and pushes them back out to the IRC channel for the viewer to read.

Most of the documentation for this bot is in the bot itself!

For a base version of this Bot check out Sprokkit [https://www.github.com/resba/Sprokkit]
